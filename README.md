Application finds max flow by applying Edmondsâ€“Karp algorithm or Dinic algorithm.

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm was implemented first, and the Dinic algorithm was added later. It was a pretty good technically task to adjust Dinic algorithm to existing classes, rather than create new ones. The parent class BaseNetflow was also created, and the specific algorithms were inherited from it, i.e. a hierarchy of classes was built.
